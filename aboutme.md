# About me?

Hi everyone, my name is Marlen Carreno. I am known as "Marlensita" or "Guerra".
I am 16 years old and a student in Franklin D Roosevelt collegian academy. I was born in Dallas TX and have never moved into another state nor country.
I have 2 younger siblings and another one on the way. I come from a race full of Mexicans. Spanish was the first language I learned.
I did not learn English until I entered the 2nd grade. My favorite subject would have to be math. I don't know as to why I like it.
I just seem to like numbers and solving problems instead of reading an assignment. I would much rather prefer doing a math test than read a book.
I'm currently working after school at family dollar and I am not in any sports this year, due to the fact of not having time.
Although, when I do have time I love going out for a run or go to the gym. My priority is graduating high school with my associates degree.
In order to do so, I will need to focus and be able to work on my classes.
I have recently been nominated to be in the Honor Society.
