# About me?
<span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>Who am I?</em></span></h3>
Hi everyone, my name is <strong>Marlen Carreno</strong>. I am known as "<em>Marlensita</em>" or "<em>Guerra</em>".
I am 16 years old and a student in Franklin D Roosevelt collegian academy. I was born in Dallas TX and have never moved into another state nor country.
I have 2 younger siblings and another one on the way. I come from a race full of Mexicans. Spanish was the first language I learned.
I did not learn English until I entered the 2nd grade. My favorite subject would have to be math. I don't know as to why I like it.
I just seem to like numbers and solving problems instead of reading an assignment. I would much rather prefer doing a math test than read a book.
I'm currently working after school at family dollar and I am not in any sports this year, due to the fact of not having time.
Although, when I do have time I love going out for a run or go to the gym. My priority is graduating high school with my associates degree.
In order to do so, I will need to focus and be able to work on my classes.
I have recently been nominated to be in the Honor Society.

<h3><span style="color: #cc99ff;">What am I doing here?</span></h3>
Funny story I got into the collegian academy without knowing, but I am glad I did because now I have an opportunity to save 2 years of college without spending any money.
It was 2 weeks before school started and me and my mom had gone to the school to enroll me.
We received a package and signed everything because we were in a hurry. I do remember the office lady explaining what the program was about.
I had no idea that it wasn't the same thing that my cousin was in, until I went to school and noticed that we we were in different buildings .
Who knew I would had ended up here. My parents want the best for me and I will try my best to make them proud. I am determine to be successful.
I have a goal and that is why I am here. I want to be able to walk down the ceremony and receive my diploma while hearing my family scream my name.
I want to be able to celebrate and be happy with my efforts. It can be a long road ,but theirs nothing that can stop me from doing what I want.
As long as I am able to pull through and not fall apart I know I can make it.

<h3><span style="color: #30b371;">Where will I take this experience?</span></h3>
As soon as I graduate I will go to college . In doing so I will take what I learned and help it guide me through out my years of studying. Since, I was able to take college classes during high school.
I will have more experience than the freshman now beginning  in their journey, but it still wont mean that I can't consider myself to be at the same level with them. Even so, I know I will be able to go through this with the help of my family and friends.

<hr />

<h3><span style="color: #fcc91e;">When will this end?</span></h3>
I can't really say when but one thing for sure is what I'm aiming for will take time. I am aiming to be an engineer. Not many females are known to work in this industry. And I want to be able to become a CEO myself. I know that my hard working will pay off someday. And for sure I will make my family proud of me. I want them to be able to tell their friends or anyone that I am successful and living it the best. Who knows? Maybe I'll be famous one day.

<hr />

<h3><span style="color: #d90bb6;">Who do I admire?</span></h3>
My mom is the person I admire. I'm sure every one does, but my mom is the most important person in my life. She got pregnant at a young age and got kicked out of her house. My dad ended up taking her in and ever since they been living together. Even when my grandparents didn't talk to my mom or even support her. She was still able to move on and be able to get what ever she needed for her children. I'm proud to say shes my mom. My mo could had aborted me, but she didn't and I than her for that because i would had never known the world.

<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">What is my favorite food?</span></h3>
I'm not any other typical girl who says she likes one certain food. I mostly eat everything. I like food that is sweet and spicy. I just can't decide what I like. Since I am Hispanic my culture eats allot of "<em>maiz</em>". When a holiday approaches,  we usually buy the ingredients 2 weeks before so we can prepare what we will cook. We usually cook <em>tamales</em>,<em>tortas</em>, <em>gorditas</em> and <em>tacos</em>. In any case, I dont have any preference in my tastes. I like trying out new things and who knows sometimes you might end up liking something you never though you would.

<hr />

<h3><span style="color: #333399;">What do I like to do in my free time?</span></h3>
I usually like to go for a walk at the park or play volleyball with my cousins. Although, its usually after school. In the weekend I usually go shopping and try new clothes. I like being unique and different. I like to dance. Whenever there's a party I ask permission to go. For me , dancing releases my stress and I get to have fun with my family and friends. What can I say? I also love going to go see how to do make up in malls or houses. I guess that's something in common I have with every girl. I also like trying out new things.Nevertheless I like watching anime.

<hr />

<h3><span style="color: #ff99cc;">What place will I visit later on?</span></h3>
I would love to go to Tokyo. I have been watching allot of Japanese anime's and movies. And it always caught my interest of how beautiful it is in the night. Or when the cherry blossoms would bloom. I would like to travel everywhere hopefully by when I'm 30 I'll had visit allot of places that I never gone.
